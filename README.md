The basis of the system are users asking questions, writing answers and comments. Creating a user is done by entering an e-mail, username and password. Users are divided into admins and regulars. The questions asked are assigned to different categories. The ranking table stores data for generating a ranking and assigning ranks to users who are rewarded with the option to change their avatar if they have a sufficiently high rank. Avatars are stored on the server and there is a link to the current graphic in the users table. The unwantedvocab table contains words that are undesirable or vulgar. The automatic user lock mechanism is based on this table. In the actualuser table we store the currently logged in users, and in the rateanswer table there are the ratings of the response data.
